# Raspberry Pi Video Looper Features
- prebuilt Raspberry Pi [images](#prebuilt-images)
- boots silently with **boot splash screen** including progress bar
- boots directly into **omxplayer**
- The device will also setup a TTY on the UART (ttyAMA0). You can connect with an USB serial converter.
- video can be put into the '/boot' folder (2GB of space available)
- No WiFi, no network.
- absolute slim buildroot distro (â‰ˆ160MB) running linux 5.10.78 kernel. Bare system takes 10MB of RAM only!

By the way: Raspberry Pi Zero W boots up in 14 seconds!

# Detailed description
Most of the buildroot adaptions are stored in the `./board/tt_rpi/rootfs-overlay` folder. After creating the `sdcard.img` it's content is placed in the root `/` folder.

Only one board configuration is available at the moment:
- `rpi0w_tt_defconfig` for RPi Zero (V1.3) and RPi Zero W (V1.1), both tested

## Custom settings
Below you will find the explanations of how the customization is made on the final running Raspberry Pi image.  
If you want to apply the settings before building, you can adapt the `board/toldotechnik_rpi/rootfs-overlay` folder. The default URL for the browser is defined in  tthe `board/toldotechnik_rpi/post-image.sh` script.

### Full screen video player
Our distro boots directly into a full screen video player. We use the super fast omxplayer which supports a lot of codecs.

To enable video playback follow these steps:
* Put the video file into the `/boot/` folder.
* Set the path of the video file in `/boot/video.txt` It should look something like this: `/boot/video1.mp4`

The video gets played in loop mode.

### Boot splash screen
Our custom boot splash is enabled by default. *Please contact us if you want another boot splash logo in a prebuilt image.*
You also can replace the logo by yourself. Please refer to the [build section](#custom-psplash-logo).

We took some existing init scripts and appended the `/usr/bin/psplash-write "PROGRESS x"` command, so the progress bar increases while booting and decreases when a shutdown is in progress.

### Serial console
The device will setup a TTY on the internal UART (ttyAMA0, baud rate: 115200). You can connect to it with an USB to serial converter. Ensure to have 3.3V level!

#### Wiring
converter (RX) - green - (TX) RPi

converter (TX) - red - (RX) RPi

Connect GND to GND if you're using different power supplies for the RPi and the serial converter.

### Root password
The root password is `root`

Please change it after first boot: `passwd root`
## Prebuilt images
Prebuilt images are freely available from our server.

- [Raspberry Pi 4](https://dev.toldotechnik.li/download/387861/) (2021-12-28)
- more to come...

Image files can be written the same way as the official Raspberry Pi images. Please see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

If you're using Etcher or the Raspberry Pi Imager, you can take the compressed image file without extracting it.

# How to build it manually
## Prerequisites for Ubuntu 18.04
    apt install -y git subversion bc zip build-essential subversion libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk gcc-multilib flex  gettext libssl-dev

    add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    apt update
    apt install gcc-8 g++-8
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8

## Building
Clone our repo.

    git clone https://github.com/TOLDOTECHNIK/Raspberry-Pi-Video-Looper

Clone the official buildroot branch 2021.11.

    git clone --branch 2021.11 https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot.git
	cd buildroot

Add our custom board folder

    cp -r ../Raspberry-Pi-Video-Looper/board/tt_rpi ./board/

Then add our custom board config

    cp ../Raspberry-Pi-Video-Looper/configs/rpi0w_tt_defconfig ./configs

Everything is ready now. You can load your board's configuration by typing

    make rpi0w_tt_defconfig

or

    make rpi4_tt_defconfig

If you want to make your own changes, run this before compiling.

    make menuconfig

Finally build everything with

    make

After a while the final image is ready to burn. You can take it from the output directory: `./output/images/sdcard.img`

## Custom psplash logo
Before building you can replace the boot screen logo by your own. Just put your transparent PNG file into `./board/tt_rpi/` Name it `psplash-logo.png`.
